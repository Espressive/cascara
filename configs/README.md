# Configs

Eventually we will probably want to also make these configs into a separate repo where they can be built and deployed as semantically versioned packages

## `eslint-config-espressive`

Exportable configs for eslint.

## `babel-preset-espressive`

Exportable configs for babel.

## `cra-template-espressive`

Create React App template for Espressive for use inside of our monorepo.

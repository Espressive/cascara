# Radio Button

A radio button is a atom level element that allows user to specify one choice amongst a series of choices.

## Patterns

- Status - Active - Selected - Not Selected - Hover - Disabled - Selected - Not Selected - Hover
  \_ Pre selection option
- Label

## Variations

- Size
- Branded
- Groups - Label - Horizontal - Vertical
- As buttons (may need to move from the button spec)

## Behavior

A default selection should always be provided within an active radio button grouping. If it is clicked again no change occurs. If a different radio button within the group is clicked on the previous radio button is deselected and the current one is selected.

## Accessibility/Localization

- RTL

## Guidelines

- A radio button cannot exist on its own. It has to be accompanied by other items/radio buttons as a grouping
- A radio button can exist without a label if it is part of a component where the user is selecting one out of many items as a group
- A radio button must be circular as this is a well known shape and it is standard. Changing the shape would confuse the user.

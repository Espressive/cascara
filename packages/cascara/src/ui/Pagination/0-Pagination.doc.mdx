# Espressive UI Pagination

This component abstracts the pagination logic into a reusable block that can be implemented anywhere pagination is required.

## Separation of concerns

The only concern of this component is to display a UI that allows the User to paginate through some content, the presentation of such content as well as its source are outside of the scope of this component.

## Using this module

A good example on how to use this module is the [Cosmos fixture](src/Pagination.fixture.js):

## Running tests

Run `yarn test` in the root of this monorepo

## Running Cosmos

Run `yarn cosmos` in the root of this monorepo

<Props of={'Pagination'} />

```jsx
<Pagination
  currentPage={1}
  entityNamePlural={'Employees'}
  entityNameSingular={'Employee'}
  isLoading={false}
  itemsPerPageLimit={10}
  recordCount={100}
>
  {/* We should create this again once we have our Table component working and we can use the globally available components from our custom MDX files */}
  {/* <CustomList data={fixtureData} /> */}
</Pagination>
```

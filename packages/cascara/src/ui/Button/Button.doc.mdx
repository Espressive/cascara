# Button

We definitely want to consume the compiled version of the components in these docs since that is what our developers will be consuming.
It feels like there is a lot of boilerplate for these MDX documents that we could definitely abstract out. Next steps will be to also make some display components to use in MDX like do/don't lists, etc. Page should probably automatically give the "name" without having to add it.

Will probably modify the Docz Props and Playground components to do a little more what we want.

Still to also explore here:

- [ ] Generate the playgrounds from fixture files
- [ ] List any atomic components that the component might be built out of (if any)

<Props of={Button} />

<Playground>
  <Button content='Docz Demo' />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button content='Positive' outcome='positive' />
</Playground>

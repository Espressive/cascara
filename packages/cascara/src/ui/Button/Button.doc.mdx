# Button

```jsx
---
title: A button can display content
---

<Button content='Hello World' />
```

```jsx
---
title: A button can be fluid
---

<Button fluid />
```

Note in the example below where we have to add a fragment. It would be great if our custom Code block would auto wrap with a fragment if we do not have a single element.

```jsx
---
title: A button can indicate outcome
---
<>
  <Button content='Positive' outcome='positive' />
  <Button content='Negative' outcome='negative' />
</>
```

```jsx
---
title: A button can have a size
---
<>
  <Button content='Small' size='small' />
  <Button content='Regular'  />
  <Button content='Large' size='large' />
</>
```

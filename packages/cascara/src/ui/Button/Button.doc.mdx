# Button

We definitely want to consume the compiled version of the components in these docs since that is what our developers will be consuming.
It feels like there is a lot of boilerplate for these MDX documents that we could definitely abstract out. Next steps will be to also make some display components to use in MDX like do/don't lists, etc. Page should probably automatically give the "name" without having to add it.

Will probably modify the Docz Props and Playground components to do a little more what we want.

Still to also explore here:

- [ ] Generate the playgrounds from fixture files
- [ ] List any atomic components that the component might be built out of (if any)

<Props of={Button} />

Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to wrap our components like this in a Playground component everywhere?

<Playground>
  <Button content='Docz Demo' />
</Playground>

What if wrapping our code examples in regular markdown code blocks worked... but if we use the jsx syntax, we don't just show the code with syntax highlighting. Instead we show an example of the component in this state and a live editor.

```jsx:A button can have content
<Button content='Docz Demo' />
```

<Playground>
  <Button content='Positive' outcome='positive' />
</Playground>

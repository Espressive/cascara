# Public API

WARNING! This is an alpha release so we can try to get this code in and working to kick the tires.

## `actions`

This is an array of objects used to tell ActionStack what to display. The `label` prop is the text for clickable element. The `onClick` prop is the click handler.

```jsx
---
title: ActionStack with Actions
---
<ActionStack
  actions={[
    {
      "label": "Action 1",
      onClick: console.log
    },
    {
      "label": "Action 2",
      onClick: console.log
    },
    {
      "label": "Action 3",
      onClick: console.log
    },
    {
      "label": "Action 4",
      onClick: console.log
    },
  ]}
/>
```

## `dropdownIndex`

A number specifying the index at which `actions` start to appear as dropdown items. The following example would render actions 1 and 2 as buttons and actions 4 and 4 as a dropdown items.

```jsx
---
title: ActionStack with dropdownIndex
---
<ActionStack
  actions={[
    {
      "label": "Action 1",
      onClick: console.log
    },
    {
      "label": "Action 2",
      onClick: console.log
    },
    {
      "label": "Action 3",
      onClick: console.log
    },
    {
      "label": "Action 4",
      onClick: console.log
    },
  ]}
  dropdownIndex={2}
/>
```

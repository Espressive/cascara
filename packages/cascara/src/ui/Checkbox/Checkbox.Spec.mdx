# Checkbox

A checkbox is an atom level element. A checkbox should be used to indicate a selection OR an optional configuration/element. A checkbox should never be used in a group where there are required choices.

## Checkbox Patterns

- States - Active - Not Selected - Selected - Indeterminate - only used in multiple selection scenarios - Disabled - Not Selected - Selected - Indeterminate - only used in multiple selection scenarios

## Checkbox Variations

- Sizes
- Branded
- Label - a checkbox can be used without a label if it is a part of another component such as a table row or list
- Group - Label - Horizontal - Vertical

## Accessibility/Localization

- RTL

## Guidelines

- Checkboxes should not be circular so they are not confused with radio buttons
- If a checkbox is disabled we need to explain to the user why it is disabled

# AreaPlaceholder

> _NOTE: Placeholder components are only intended for use during development and should not be used in production._

AreaPlaceholder can be used to wrap an area of UI with a helpful label. This is especially helpful when working with Context or State in complex components to help visualize compositional hierarchy.

```jsx
---
title: Default display
---
<AreaPlaceholder label='Label' />
```

```jsx
---
title: Can be open on mount
---
<JsonPlaceholder data={{
  stuff: {
    okay: true,
    something: 23,
    string: 'cool',
  },
}} isInitialOpen />
```

```jsx
---
title: Can display a unique title
---
<JsonPlaceholder data={{
  stuff: {
    okay: true,
    something: 23,
    string: 'cool',
  },
}} title='Custom Title' />
```

```jsx
---
title: If needed, can be customized
---
<JsonPlaceholder
  data={{
  stuff: {
    okay: true,
    something: 23,
    string: 'cool',
  },
}}
  style={{ maxWidth: '50%', backgroundColor: 'red' }}
  title='Style'
/>
```

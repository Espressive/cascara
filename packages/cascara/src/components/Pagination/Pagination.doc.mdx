# Public API

WARNING! This is an alpha release so we can try to get this code in and working to kick the tires.

## Loading

When defining no props, the component does not blow up. This is also a
potential state the component might be in during loading. Any interactive
elements should be disabled.

```jsx
---
title: Pagination in a loading state
---
<Pagination />
```

## totalRecordCount

A number that specifies the length of the data.

### Empty

After loading data and passing props to our component, it is possible that data has a length of 0. In such cases, the component still have disabled input
but the user will see additional indication that there are no records to display.

```jsx
---
title: Pagination with dropdownIndex
---
<Pagination totalRecordCount={0} />
```

### With data but no state

When we have a `totalRecordCount` greater than 1, Pagination values are displayed. Nothing is broken and it presents correctly.

```jsx
---
title: With data but no state
---
<Pagination totalRecordCount={65} />
```

> Use the `usePaginationState` hook to provide this component with state.

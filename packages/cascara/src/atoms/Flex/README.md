This component will eventually go back to Cascara. We can probably safely export it atomically as well. Instead of everyone having to write the same styles over and over again for the correct flexbox structures everywhere, we can just a have component wrapper to do the same thing. This should allow us to more quickly arrange our components in rows or columns without trying to share styles everywhere for consistency.

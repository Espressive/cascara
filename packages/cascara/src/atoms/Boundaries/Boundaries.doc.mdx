Boundaries is a POC for an error boundary and suspense boundary component which has a baked in default for both boundary types. This will likely become part of, or replace, the existing esp-ui-errorboundary package. It would make most sense to become esp-ui-boundaries package which would export main: `Boundaries`, and sub members `ErrorBoundary` and `SuspenseBoundary`. Boundaries would contain both and expose the API for both internal boundaries as optional props.

Replacing esp-ui-errorboundary would be a mater of changing the imports of that package:

```
// before
import ErrorBoundary from 'esp-ui-errorboundary';

// after
import {ErrorBoundary} from 'esp-boundaries';
```

# Examples

## Default

```jsx
<Boundaries>
  <h1>Hi</h1>
</Boundaries>
```

## Invalid Fallbacks

```jsx
<>
  <h2>Invalid Fallbacks</h2>
  <p>
    If an invalid React component is defined for either fallback component,
    there should be a prop-type warning. Both of these should throw warnings.
  </p>
  <Boundaries
    ErrorComponent={<TestFallbackComponent />}
    SuspenseComponent={<TestFallbackComponent />}
  >
    <h1>Hi</h1>
  </Boundaries>
</>
```

## Error Fallback

```jsx
<ErrorFallback error={{ message: 'This is a dummy error' }} />
```

## Suspense Fallback

```jsx
<SuspenseFallback />
```

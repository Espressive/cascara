# DataJson

For now we are going to keep this module private. Technically it works but we do not want to tell people about it for now. Eventually it would be nice to have a JSON module that allows a nice, full editing experience with formatting help and everything. This is basically being used as a helpful field when we are inferring type and we need some way to render an object or array field.

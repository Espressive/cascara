title: Functional Design System
description: Functional Design Systems (FDS), Design Systems, UI Libraries, and what we are trying to achieve.
---

Cascara is a Functional Design System (FDS). But what _is_ a FDS and how is it different/similar to a Design System or UI Library? What are we trying to achieve by building a FDS instead of only a Design System or UI Library instead? To begin, we need to understand what a Design System is and what sorts of challenges it is intended to solve.

## What Is A Design System?

Design Systems come in different sizes and scope, but essentially, they can be defined as follows:

> A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize, and develop a product.

This will typically include, but not limited to, the following groups:

- **Brand Guidelines** (Color, Typography, Logo, Copy)
- **UI Library** (Components, Layout, Animation)
- **User Experience** (Patterns, Rules, Principles)
- Icons/Images/Illustrations

### Value Proposition

There are [plenty](https://reusserdesign.com/resources/articles/why-should-you-consider-a-design-system) of [other articles](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/guide-to-design-systems/) about [design systems](https://uxdesign.cc/what-the-heck-is-a-design-system-c89a8ea73b0d) and their advantages, so let's wrap up with the benefits of a Design System that are most valuable to us at Espressive:

- Faster time to market
- More consistent user experience
- Codebase becomes more stable and easier to maintain
- Increased efficiency in decision making

## What is a _Functional_ Design System?

If you're caught up on what a Design System is and what some of the elements of a Design System are, we can ask: What is the _functional_ part of a Functional Design System?

> A Functional Design System is a superset of a design system which has additional components that help it enforce experience, patterns, and other rules of the Design System as a whole.

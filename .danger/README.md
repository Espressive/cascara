# Danger JS

[Danger.js](https://danger.systems/js/) is being used to evaluate the most common issues we have with our pull requests. Instead of making developers ask for corrections in titles, description changes stating why dependencies were added, etc... we can instead automate checks for these items so developers can spend time evaluating code instead of evaluating if people are following our process.

The goal is to have the team slowly add rules and tests over time to improve common, repetitive PR tasks.

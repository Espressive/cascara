# Husky

version: 4.3.0
Date: 2020-09-07

### Notes

We didn't go all the way to [v7.0.4](https://github.com/typicode/husky/releases/tag/v7.0.4) because in v5.0.0 they changed the license from MIT to The Parity Public License, we cannot use it for commercial purposes.
v4.3.0 seems to work just fine without us going and changing any config. We'll stay with that one.

### Features

- Add .cjs config file support #754

### Ecosystem updates

- none

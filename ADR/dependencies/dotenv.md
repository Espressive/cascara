# Dotenv

Version: 8.2.0
Date: 20191015

The repository of dotenv doesn't maintain a changelog nor they have any releases, only tags. They seem not to be following the `semver` standard. This makes it difficult to follow up and see it there are any breaking changes.
In later versions, `dotenv` won't support prefix invocation, such as the one we use for `Framer`. There is a `dotenv-cli` tool for that, but we would be adding more dependencies. Since `dotenv` is only used for non-critical tasks like `Framer`, is in our interest to keep the current version as it still does what we want.

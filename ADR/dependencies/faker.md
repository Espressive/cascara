# Faker

Faker has been moved from a [personal github account](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js#readme) to an [organization](https://github.com/faker-js), this change broke the history of the repository. There is no v6.6.6 as vscode suggests, [v6 is still in alpha](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/releases/tag/v6.0.0-alpha.7).
Faker is only used in Fixtures and tests, it is not a critical part of Cascara so we are sticking to our current versions. No updated dependencies.

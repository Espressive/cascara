# Espressive UI Pagination
This component abstracts the pagination logic into a reusable block that can be implemented anywhere pagination is required.

## Separation of concerns
The only concern of this component is to display a UI that allows the User to paginate through some content, the presentation of such content as well as its source are outside of the scope of this component.

## Using this module
A good example on how to use this module is the [Cosmos fixture](src/Pagination.fixture.js):

## Running tests
Run `yarn test` in the root of this monorepo

## Running Cosmos
Run `yarn cosmos` in the root of this monorepo

<Props of={Pagination} />

<Playground>
  <Pagination
    currentPage={1}
    entityNamePlural={'Employees'}
    entityNameSingular={'Employee'}
    isLoading={false}
    itemsPerPageLimit={10}
    recordCount={100}
  >
    <CustomList data={fixtureData} />
  </Pagination>
</Playground>

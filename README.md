## Get Started: Docs

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (UX Team will use [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) to do this)
2. Open the repository in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Open a new terminal to run some commands using Terminal > New Terminal or the shortut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>~</kbd>
4. In the terminal, install all dependencies by running: `yarn install`\*
5. To start the docs, run `yarn docs start`
6. Visit the following link in your browser: http://localhost:3000/
7. Edit any MDX files in `/packages/cascara/src` or in `/docs/src/mdx` and they will automatically reload

> \*It is possible you may not have node or yarn installed on your system. If so, please follow the additional steps below before moving forward.

#### Install NVM

We need to install node. There are reasons we will likely have to change to different versions of Node at times. Therefore we should install Node Version Manager to allow us to switch versions easily.

1. Run the CURL command in the terminal to install:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

2. Verify that `nvm` has been installed:

```bash
nvm version
```

3. If the output of the above command is `v14.5.0` you are done! ðŸŽ‰
4. If not... set the current version of node to 14.5.0:

```bash
nvm install 14.5.0
nvm alias default 14.5.0
```

5. Go back to step 2 and verify the correct version of Node is installed

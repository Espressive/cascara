# Layout

These packages should contain application specific layout components. Generally these components will be used to create an application layout consistently and should in theory be used compositionally as JSX elements to give us an expected layout. This means their API will likely differ from that of the other FDS components which will push more for a "shorthand" API which will essentially be a AST of the functionality that we want these components to use.
